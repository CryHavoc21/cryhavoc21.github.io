<h2>This is my scrappy solution to selling photo prints</h2>

<p>I wanted to get some real directions out there before I actually put time and money into a real seller website</p>

<h2>Print bundles available:</h2>
<ul>
        <li><b>Six Photo Bundle:</b> six 4x6" prints that I will put in an envelope and mail to you. <b>$10 USD</b></li>
        <li><b>Twelve Photo Bundle:</b> twelve 4x6" prints that I will put in an envelope and mail to you. <b>$15 USD</b></li>
        <li><b>Postcard:</b> a single 4x6" print that I will mail to you like a postcard. <b>$2 USD</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>A note on <b>4x6"</b> prints</h2>
<p>For technical reasons, some of my 4x6" prints are not exactly 4 inches by 6 inches: they are slightly shorter on the longer side. This means the final size is closer to 4" by 5.75". Also, the photos are printed on varieties of glossy paper, but may not all be printed on the same paper stocks.</p>

<h2>Photos available</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Color photos</li>
        <li>Black and white photos</li>
        <li>Cityscapes</li>
        <li>Street candid photos</li>
        <li>Rapid transit photos</li>
        <li>Nature photos</li>
</ul>
